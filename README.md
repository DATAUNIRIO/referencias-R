# Data Mining
- scorer: A set of tools for quickly scoring models in data science and machine learning. 
- arules: Mining Association Rules and Frequent Itemsets
- klaR:	Miscellaneous functions for classification and visualization developed at the Fakultaet Statistik, Technische Universitaet Dortmund
- Daim: Diagnostic accuracy of classification models.
- clusteval:	An R package that provides a suite of tools to evaluate clustering algorithms, clusterings, and individual clusters.
